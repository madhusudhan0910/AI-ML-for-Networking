# 🛡️ AI-ML-for-Networking: Real-Time SQL Injection & XSS Detection

A real-time machine learning-based detection tool for identifying **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks. Built with **FastAPI**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Redis** for asynchronous queue handling and deployed using **Docker**.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project detects and classifies user inputs (such as URLs or strings) into categories like:

- **Benign**
- **SQL Injection**
- **XSS**
- **Malicious**

It provides both a **single payload tester** and a **file upload scanner**, with results displayed through a web interface in real time.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhusudhan0910/AI-ML-for-Networking.git
cd AI-ML-for-Networking
```

---

### 2. Install Requirements (Optional for local run without Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Train the ML Model

```bash
python app/train_model.py
```

> Make sure `sqlxss_mixed_dataset.csv` exists in the `data/` folder.

---

### 4. Start the Project Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up:

- 🚀 FastAPI app at `http://localhost:8000`  
- 🧠 Redis instance  
- 🔁 Background consumer to process threats  

---

## 🌐 Web Interface Usage

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

You can:

- Paste a string or URL into the single input field to detect threats.
- Upload `.txt` or `.csv` files with multiple payloads.
- View results instantly, color-coded based on the classification.
